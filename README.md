My little sandbox containing only unfinished & dropped ideas


##Useful git hacks:

1. `git gc` - cleanup unnecessary files and optimize the local repository - show some stats of repo
2. `git-count-objects -vH` - Count unpacked number of objects and their disk consumption
3. `git push origin :branch_name` - removes remote/origin/branch_name
